Introduction:
--------------------------
The role of the hotel industry stems from a long history and development in the field of hospitality
provision. In many countries hotels have evolved as extensions of domestic hospitality; though typically
they are more often larger establishments (particularly in developed countries)
Industry groups in different countries may define a hotel in different ways. A typical definition might be:
“A hotel is an establishment of a permanent nature, which consists of four or more bedrooms, and offers
bed and breakfast on a short term contract and provides certain minimum standards”
(Ref: Hotels and Catering Economic Development Committee, South Africa).
Hotels may be classified in many different ways, for different purposes, to different countries.
